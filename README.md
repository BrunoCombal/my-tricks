# Introduction

I am a researcher, specialized in Earth monitoring.
I was struck to see that many colleagues are often struggling with their datasets. Some recurrent questions concern data transformation: how to transform a given format into another that their favorite software can open?

Writing a well structure handbook seems to me both too ambitious and frustrating. Too ambitious because it would require effort I can't really afford. Frustrating because structure a book for educational purpose would require that I focus on few aspects.
After some unfructous attempts to write some conventional text, I realised the following:
* I don't want to write another book starting from the ground, explaning basics about Linux;
* I want to share as much of my knowledge I can;
* I'm not looking for any academic recognition, I just want too help some sibling, desperately trying to figure out how to do some operations that should be so simple.

This book is nothing but a somewhat structure series of tricks plus some usage I tested and bulletproofed. I'm not developping any theory or principle, neither advocating for some technology. I suppose that my reader is a scientist or data expert, sufficiently computer litterate to write some simple data processing code and conscious that all the work can't be done in a single software. Professional software developpers may find my examples rather naive.
