## Re-ordering tabulated values
 colleague sent me a CSV file, formatted as a rectangular array:

|       | Y 1 | Y 2 | ... | Y 180 |
| --    | --  | --  | -- | -- |
| X 1   |     |     |    |    |
| X 2   |     |     |    |    |
| ...   |     |     |    |    |
| X 360 |     |     |    |   &nbsp; |

I needed to export this array into a shapefile. The formatting is actually unsual, as I would prefer having a list of x, y, val.
