# Cleaning up a file

Often, data files are a bit messy:
* Un-sorted data
* Ill-formatted text
* Too many fields


Basic commands for processing text-based data sets are:
* grep: keep lines matching a given pattern, or discard lines matching a pattern
* sed: do operation on regular expressions
* cut: extract fields from a text file
* awk: write complex programs on formatted text files

## Chaining commands

### Basic commands
Basic commands like `more`or `less` let you display the content of a file.

Commands to transform a file into a data stream:
`cat`, `head` and `tail`

### Pipes: sending command output to another command
